# Introduction
Test
Shangrila Veterans (and first responders) Healing Places is a place where service members can live, play and heal. There 
are communities that are specifically designed in order to enable hope and healing for the worldwide veterans community. 

The idea is being shared leveraging principles from the open-source community. However proper and on-going care and 
consultation (see below) will be necessary in order to implement the idea in a way that brings hope and healing, while respecting and 
protecting individual privacy during all the times. The focus is on care. I guess, the the places themselves could be 
renamed as '**care valleys**' or '**valleys of care**.'

There will be initial and then on-going consulations with clinicians, other medical/evidence based practitioners. But also 
urban designers, 
architects (particularly architecture focused on enabling healthier communities and settings), sociologists, policy makers 
e.t.c

# Hope
With proper approvals and protocols (safety, security, evidence based practice) being followed, this idea could evolve in a 
variety of ways.The initial set of meditations focus on enabling such a reality in a mixed real-estate sense across the 
United States and Canada. Mixed real-estate means that there will be facilities for healing of different types. But also 
places where veterans and their families could live and work. Where veterans and also civilians could find meaningful work. 

# Background
Shangrila Veterans (and first responders) is an idea that I thought of around the end of 2022. I initially got this idea while
I was volunteering my time for a US based non-profit (in a unofficial capacity). Before I continue, I must state that 
personally I am a civilian and I have not been in contact with any government or military (and other associated) 
agency/agencies as of yet.

## USC ICT
As a bit of a background, I have been intrigued with specific projects out of USC (University of Southern California). And
how new and existing technologies are being deployed in order to bring hope and healing into the lives of veterans. There 
are specific technologies developed at USC for treating PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress). That being said, the scope of the 
veterans valley isn't necessarily PTS focused. But a team of humans and machines must definitely be incentivized in order 
to further enable designs for effectively treating PTS.

Next, there is particular project out of USC-ICT (Institute of Creative Technologies) called 'Bravemind.' This project has 
been in development for a number of years and here is the [link 
here](https://ict.usc.edu/research/projects/bravemind-virtual-reality-exposure-therapy)

Again, I do not have any affiliation with USC or any other institution. Also, I cannot say that I actively keep update with 
the news and developments related to Bravemind and other projects. 

## OZ Investors (Private entity)
Next and last year, I installed an app called Clubhouse. The quality of the algorithms for this app in particular has a lot to
be desired for. That being said, there are a few really awesome places on Clubhouse (rooms inside clubs). One of the rooms is 
hosted by a for-profit organization called EazyDoIt Inc. 

*OZ investors **is a private organization** that offers training and consultancy* on a (**public**) tax incentive offered by the US Government via the IRS (Internal Revenue Service). **Note**: Mentioning an institution or 
individual does not equal endorsement. [Link to OZ investment Club - Private institution via

and [Link to one of OZ investment's website](https://www.opportunityzoneclub.com/)

## IRS's Opportunity Zones and Opportunity Funds
The actual tax-incentive offered by the IRS is called 'Opportuniy Zones' and according to the IRS website (link below):

'Opportunity Zones are an economic development tool that allows people to invest in distressed areas in the United States.

Their purpose is to spur economic growth and job creation in low-income communities while providing tax benefits to investors.'

Coming back to the Opportunity Zones and Opportunity Funds program(s). From my uneducated perspective, these 
incentive structures offered by the IRS have the best of intentions and the thinking behind such a program (to me) seems 
very healthy. The thing to realize is that as good as this program is/could be, this is one of the many possible 
incentives that could be offered by various governments and other institutions around the world.

# P.I.E: Plan | Implement | Evaluate
## Core considerations
From my very limited background as a civilian, I would think that the needs within the veteran community are unique. As 
well, there will probably be safety and security related considerations to be had. As you probably do not want to have 
clusters of real-estate, where security is not thought through and that such developments have a very high density of 
veterans. **Such a design could be a target for individuals and groups who wish to cause harm. Particularly if the details 
related to the developments are public for the whole world to see.** Next, the medical and other needs of the community 
also need to be thought through in advance. Whether it's to design spaces keeping in mind the physiology and psychological 
setbacks. Won't be jumping into solution mode, but maybe such towns/communities do not need as many cars. The landscape is 
designed keeping wheelchairs and also folks using prostethics making use of really wide and super safe side-walks. Other 
set of designs could be enabled in order to enable work for veterans who are transitioning from military life to civilian 
life. As well, different designs and processes would be thought through in order to help solve a variety of problems. 

## Construction of such facilities
Personally, I like to keep a surface level overview of what is/has been going on in the additive-manufacturing space. So 
having done this for more than a decade now (plus/minus), I have some ideas in order to provision physical facilities 
safely and yet inexpensively. Particularly seeing that 3d-printing organizations like ICON 3D have successfully 
collaborated with the US Marines in the recent past. Source link is below and it contains an accompanying video and a 
few images:

[ICON 
3d](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/u-s-marines-use-icon-3d-printing-to-create-concrete-structures-at-camp-pendleton-174200/)

[ICON 3d - website](https://www.iconbuild.com/), [Wasp - Italy](https://www.3dwasp.com/) are the names of two startups 
operating in this space. There are now dozens (if not more) companies active here on a world-wide basis.

### Applied imagination
During the holiday (2022) season, I started tinkering with [OpenAI's ChaptGPT](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwje4fqGobz8AhW5EFkFHQQeCfgQFnoECAkQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fopenai.com%2Fblog%2Fchatgpt%2F&usg=AOvVaw07ciM_LkSe6efpFVXLmYhu)
This development is getting a fair bit of buzz. Personally, I was tryng to get it to write code for me for Blender, FreeCAD 
and a number of other open-source tools. 

The images below were **not generated with OpenAI** (none of their services). The images below were generated via a 
website from Japan. I forget the name right now. As I ended up cropping these images and choosing to over-write the files 
vs saving a copy.

- Looking at the mountains in the distance, this first image here could be of a drive up to a Shangrila Veterans Healing 
Place community somewhere out on the West coast. **Note*: Apologize for the **arrows** and **like** buttons in the pictures. **Clicking on them is not going to do anything**

- Next image is of a wide open space, where hydrogen powered/self-driving buses (with attendants on-board) are parked. 
These buses will pick and drop passengers who do not necessarily live in the healing valleys themselves. But either take 
the buses for the purposes of seeking therapy, recreational activities, leisure, socializing, work e.t.c.

- Birds-eye view of one of the developments

- Healthcare, recreational, research facilities and also office spaces
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-211852.png)

- Drive through one of the neighbourhoods
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-211911.png)

- Backyard one of the main facilities. Where there will be clinical and other therapeutic services. Outdoor events and 
parties could be held in this backyard. (Weddings, graduation ceremonies e.t.c)
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-200410.png)

- Another view of the backyard " " with a pond. You could also play mini golf here or just sit by the pond and enjoy the 
sunset. 
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-200427.png)

- I forget what was the prompt that I provided here. But this could be the drive/walk to a place where you could go for 
quality and nutritious foods. As well, maybe maintain one facility where quality and nutritious foods are prepared by 
robots mostly. 
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-211819.png)

- Final in this series of images is a collage. I cannot remember the prompt that I provided. But looks like there are some 
fields in some of the images the AI (Artificial Intelligence) generated. 
![](img/Screenshot_20230101-211808.png)

Overall, I imagine these locations to be mixed real estate facilities for enabling hope and healing.
Whereby humans and robots would collaborate in order to bring hope and healing for veterans, first responders, healthcare 
workers from all over the world. I haven't had a chance to develop the care-giving robots side of things. But I'd love to 
somehow collaborate with [Awakening Health](https://awakening.health/) and USC ICT (link shared previously)

#Let's Collaborate
I would **absolutely love feedback** and I seek to collaborate with you on this project. It is my hope that this project 
could be undertaken by the veteran community themselves. It would be amazing to see secure, structurally stable, 
intelligently designed architecture take roots. A community that learns from it's experiences and evolves. A community 
where there is no judgement and we lead with an open hand. A community of 'hope and healing.'
