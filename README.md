## 🌟 Mission & Vision

Shangrila-VHP is a project that brings the world-wide community together to enable hope and healing.

### Core Metrics & Focus
- **Target Cost**: $5,000 CAD (plummeting to $1,000 or less within 10 years).
- **Primary Focus**: Veterans housing, single parents, and those experiencing homelessness.
- **Next Focus**: Global scale-up.
- **Impact**: Healing-focused community design.

> "Less, but better."
> — Dieter Rams, *Ten Principles for Good Design*

### The Problem
One veteran or first-responder experiencing homelessness is too many. We believe this problem is solvable. After ensuring safety for every veteran and first-line staff across NATO and core allies, Shangrila will advance towards quality housing worldwide.

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### Large-Scale 3D Printing
The first major milestone is the enablement of a large-scale open-source 3D-printer capable of printing with earthen materials.
- **In-house Development**: Cost-effective alternative to expensive commercial printers.
- **Materials**: Mud and organic mixtures for sustainable, high-quality dwellings.

### Modular & Autonomous Manufacturing
- **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**: Focused on modular designs (e.g., doors and hinges) so structures can be moved or expanded.
- **Autonomous Manufacturing Units (AMUs)**: Exploring self-replicating manufacturing units to safeguard the future through education and automation.
  - - Note: The heavy lifting is via a sister organization via [ASI or Awakened Imagination - Yet to be registered](https://github.com/stellardreams/asi.surge.sh)

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Phases

1.  **Phase 01**: OKR-based goals to end veteran homelessness with VA, NATO, and allies.
2.  **Phase 01-a**: Customer Obsession — feedback from Veteran Affairs on facility designs.
3.  **Phase 01-b**: Parallel elimination of homelessness in the single parents category.
4.  **Phase 02**: Global leverage for sustainable/affordable housing resilient to climate change.

### Prototyping History
- **Pizza Box Model**: The very first conceptualization used recycled materials.
- **TinkerCAD & 3D Printing**: Transitioned to digital design and physical scale models.
- **Zen Garden Addition**: Meditative spaces integrated into the living environment for tranquility.
