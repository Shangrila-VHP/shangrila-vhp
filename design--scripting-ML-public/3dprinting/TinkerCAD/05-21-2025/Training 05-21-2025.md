- [x] Training: Core focus [Tinker with TinkerCAD](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38).
- - ðŸŽ¯ Target is to complete 1 to 2 chapters from the book each day. Which could take 2 to 6 hours of [Deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
- - - Did not tackle items from the book. Spent 5.5 hours (update 8 plus hours in total, including session during evening) on two activities. Bulk of the time was spent trying to get the door, hinges. Spent some time trying to get the ramp working also
- - - [x] Updates will go directly inside of the container (link is above)
- **Note to self**: This is where the markdown file is located: Under ....  -> design-and-scripting-public -> 3dprinting -> TinkerCAD -> In the folder for the day(s)
