- [x] Training: Core focus [Tinker with TinkerCAD](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38).
  - Pickup the door and hinges exercise from day before yesterday [same link as above](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38) 3.5 hours of pure focused effort today. Must take breaks!
  - I will try and remember to upload .stl files [here](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/tree/main/design-and-scripting-public/3dprinting/TinkerCAD/_stl%20files) in the future. Within reason.
