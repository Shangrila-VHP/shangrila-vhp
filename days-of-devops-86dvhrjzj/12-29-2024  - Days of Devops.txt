###Standard Logs

## Session 01: [16:00 to 17:21]
- Ran out of space <redacted>. Space was being taken up by 01. Timeshift snapshots. 02. Python virtual environment. I had to blow up the entire environment for python 03. Some system logs (about 2 Gigs). 
-- Cleaned up the space, with assistance. 
-- Disabled Timeshift snapshots
--  [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]  
- 17:00 Downloading an ISO prior to break.
-- Downloading Ubuntu Server prior to break. For manual install.

## Session 02: [17:49 to 18:23]
- Action items (two) to tackle in sequence, after the break. Moved to Session 03 at 18:22  
- 17:49 Back. Writing ISO in order to boot. 
- 18:02 Default Burner app keeps throwing errors. I wonder if it will still burn the image, even though it keeps throwing errors
-- Switched to Brasero. Which was also throwing errors. After a search via forums, the following entry 'could' help avoid the errors. It's been a while since I burned an image. So let's simulate it first. Thanks to the following individual on the interwebs (below). And thanks to Vice President Al-Gore for inventing the internet.

   Brasero doesn't know it's supposed to burn an image (as opposed to just data) unless you tell it...               
   Try right-clicking on the iso file you have downloaded and then choose "burn to disk," and Brasero gets it        
   from there.                                                                                                       
   One more thing to check, and I only mention it because I made this mistake only yesterday - make sure the         
   blank CD is a CD and not a DVD!                                                                                   
   Cheers,

--- Note to self:
---- It's slightly different for me. As in, I have to right-click on the iso and then 'open' it in Brasero. vs the "burn to disk," option. It's interesting that the user placed a comma inside of double-quotes. 
---- Machine/Tower doesn't like it when tower is placed flat on the surface vs standard position. As the DVD wobbles inside the DVD tray while data is being written to it.

## Session 03: [REDACTED] [Multi hour segment]  [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]

- 19:13 Installing 'cdrdao' & then xfburn
- 19:18 Checking to see if Checksum is progressing by moving the gui closer to the edge of the window. lazy hack. The process is active. I guess I could find out the rate at which the process is writing to the DVD.
-- 19:22 Think the checksum is stuck. So I will reboot & try the dvd in the other machine.
-- 19:34 I don't think the DVD was written to properly. Boot is taking a long time to load from DVD. I'll work interchagably between micro-sd and DVD
--- But first, removing Brasero. I haven't had success with Brasero for many years now. I don't know why I keep installing it again. Maybe because I never documented this before.
--- After a couple of attempts, I am going to download a minimal vesion of the server, burn it to a CDROM vs a DVD and give it a try. This will save time and also put the CDROMs to use. 
---- Note to self: k3b works for writing to cdroms. Hopefully DVDs also?

-- Thought: It would be nice to have a robot around. Or two. Or more! They could be much smaller for the purpose of utility. 
- 22:35 Well, I now [REDACTED] up and running. It's actually incredibly nimble and I have yet to install [REDACTED].[LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]
-- 23:16 For the other machine, I attempted to setup the timeshift utility, but it's going to require a bit more nuance. So I have added an action item below. [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]
- [WHOLE SECTION BELOW REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]

#### Procedural documentation identified | Selecive items, Moved to the 'Procedural documentation identified.md' documentation
-- 23:34 This is how to initiate a python virtual environment on [REDACTED] as [REDACTED]
cd /home/<username redacted>/myproject-12-29-2024 # 
source myenv/bin/activate
(myenv) /home/<username redacted>/myproject-12-29-2024 # whoami

(myenv) /home/<username redacted>/myproject-12-29-2024 # 
- [WHOLE SECTION ABOVE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]
- Reminder: To install python packages in the virtual environment. Issue the following command (in the virtual environment) and as an example: pip3 install numpy
- 23:57 Continue here at [REDACTED]: https://www.springboard.com/blog/data-science/python-libraries-for-machine-learning/
-- 00:11 Some went through and others are throwing errors. 
-- 00:18 Action item item: Installing java for Alda. Not Allan from M.A.S.H though.  https://github.com/alda-lang/alda?tab=readme-ov-file
--- 00:23 Continue alda installation by putting it on path (Step 3): https://alda.io/install/ 
- 00:30 Was thinking about give this a try: scriptmonkey: https://github.com/lukerbs/ScriptMonkey 
-- Search string: 'automatically fix python package during installation using ai' 
--- Requires OpenAI key. Will check it out later.

- Rebooting new host. Fingers crossed the python environment remains intact. It should. 
- Docker main commands:
-- [To list docker sessions] docker ps 
-- [To start a docker container using example from their hub] docker run -dp 80:80 docker/getting-started 
-- [To stop a docker container] docker stop <id for container using docker ps, step above>
--- Further details via the following simple yet well-written post: https://linuxhandbook.com/docker-stop-container/ 
- Note: This command helps add docs, which is like [REDACTED] for [REDACTED]: [REDACTED] 
-- Found under the comments here and the command above works. h[REDACTED] So the instructions here are redundant I am guessing. Update: after the [REDACTED] I have [REDACTED] [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]

## Session 04: [REDACTED] [Multi hour segment] 
- 04:19 Figuring samba issues. Now just beginning to learn about ACL (Access control lists)
- 04:40 Problem was solved another way. I installed the [REDACTED] plugin in VS Code Studio and I am editing this file [REDACTED] now. I am going to [REDACTED] [REDACTED] and see what happens. Fingers crossed! This is amazing.
- 05:40 [REDACTED] issues. Action items updated below. [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]
- 05:45 Now going line by line to redact information and update github with cleaned up version.
- 06:05 Note to self: Making steady progress. [3s] Sweep. Sort. Standardize. I kind of like this new format. It gives me a singular visual into what I did today. Previously I was categorizing the containers (between 1 to 3) and pulling them into a file that I refer to as '3 things.' I still do that. But '3 things', by itself requires for me to go into three different containers. Anyhow, all of these updates are going to go into one container. I am still very much so putting the PM Tool to use. As I pay for it each month.
- Note: The command to shutdown [REDACTED] is [REDACTED] [LINE MARKED TO BE REDACTED FOR PUBLIC NOTES]

----- xx:xx Take a break and do some pushups [Hmm, this I need to actually start doing and do it more often!]


- [OPEN]: This is not related to Shangrila-VHP. Separately, today I wanted to try ALDA: Making music using code. This is why I logged in! But, hey, good lesson to be learned here on how to reclaim disk space. Once I reclaimed the disk space, I realized how crucial it was for me to get the other machine working and put it's processing power to use. I am proud of the set of achivements via these Sprint like Days of Devops! Pat myself on the back. Now that I am reviewing these notes 2 days later, it is interesting that I had mentioned Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky on a private group that I started. Sprints, can indeed be highly productive and useful! 


### Action items with status All 'OPEN' action items transferred to Project Management software of choice:
- [NOT NEEDED/CLOSED]: Format SSD again. Create new Startup Disk Creator. But use a lighter ISO. 

- [CLOSED]: Work interchagably between micro-sd and DVD and now CDROMs: Format micro-sd again. Create new Startup Disk Creator. But use a lighter ISO. Seeing this microsd is borked, switching to DVD. Once back, install [distro] using DVD.

- [CLOSED]: Figure out what else is taking up the space on the local disk

- [CLOSED]: Make a note that python virtual environments take up a lot of space. The process of creating virtual environments and activating, deactivating and if needed, getting rid of them has to be documented properly. 

- [TRANSFERRED]: Look into https://canonical.com/multipass & https://ubuntu.com/download/server#automated-provisioning also

- [TRANSFERRED]: This piqued my interest: https://ubuntu.com/observability/what-is-observability & I noticed that Ubuntu offers the building of a private cloud: I guess this is separate: https://ubuntu.com/observability/what-is-observability

- [TRANSFERRED] Tinker with jupyter and see what benefits it provides.

- [CLOSED] Documented how to open and close python virtual environments. Also from ssh. 

- [CLOSED]: Add all times to project management software & update Github for S-vhp

- [OPEN]: Update the newly added Wins section below.


### Wins today
- [Ok win] Reclaimed space on existing machine. 
- [Good Win!] Got new machine up and running. Putting the 8 cores to use. The new distro handles the cpus well and so far the machine is not over-heating. This makes me realize how efficiently software can handle the hardware or to the contrary. It reminds me of a conversation I had, albeit briefly with someone back in the year 2012. However, I have yet to find a 'sensors' package for the distro I am leveraging. 
- [Okay win that will yield dividends] Learning how to setting up python virtual environment. 
- [Okay Win that will yield dividends] [Beginning to tinker with docker (nano win) 
- [Standard Win] Installed, update definitions and run anti-virus scan.
