### Standard Logs
19:07 Starting session. Reviewing these notes again, I was simply trying to get a more light-weight browser installed. As the standard set of browsers can be resource intensive. 
19:10 Installing jupyter on <name redacted>
- `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
- Removing midori using snap. It's not working. The keyboard is not working on it for some reason.
- Installing falkon
- Back to pip and jupyter notebooks installation
  - `pip3 install --upgrade pip`
  - 19:25 This machine is extremely slow.
  - `pip3` installations are not working.
- Fixing ssh access issues <redacted>. With assistance from ChatGPT.
  - **WIN!**: 19:58 and I am able to <redacted> Wooho! WIN!
  - **WIN!**: 20:07 Not only is <redacted> working. The ssh issues are also resolved!
  - <redacted> layers of security for <redacted>
  - <redacted>
  - **Note to self**: Sometimes stepping away from the problem for a bit helps. Because I was going in circles last night and was not focusing on what the AI was telling me and skipping details. Update: If we pay attention, then the instructions via the intelligence that is independent of the substrate can be incredibly useful. Depends on the context, I guess. But for technical stuff like sysadmin, it's really good imho.
- 20:12 Getting to Jupyter now. With help from ChatGPT. ChatGPT warned me that support for my version of <redacted> was decommissioned as of the year 2020. So I might wipe the machine clean and install the latest version of Ubuntu. Update: It is early in the morning now and this is exactly what I am doing.
- 20:16 Some errors. ChatGPT is assisting me.
- `conda update pandas` command is taking a long time
- Next: I need to: `pip3 install jupyter` and `pip3 install jupyterlab`
- **Note to self**: I used <redacted> (For future references)
- While <redacted> is frozen. I might as well, install and update python on the machine here called <redacted>
- 20:46 Now installing GitHub, numpy, etc.
- 20:50 Installing a bunch of stuff ChatGPT recommended for fun projects. Including machine learning.
- 20:54 Take a stretch break. When machine done installing. Continue at following via instructions on the browser: `pip install lightgbm`
- 21:21 Well, things are getting installed on both the machines. It's time to take a break.
- 21:39 <redacted> .... After taking a really long time, pandas installation on <redacted> seems to be progressing well. The disk space should, for now, not be an issue on there. As <redacted> are still available. However, captured in the action items below, stuff will have to be removed from this <redacted> box, because of lack of space. I might as well interrupt the installation on the local box here and uninstall all the stuff. Let's do that now.

### In Summary:
- Deactivating won't affect the installed packages.
- To ensure packages aren't lost, either back up the environment or save the list of dependencies to a `requirements.txt` file.
- To reiterate, if you delete the virtual environment, you will lose all the packages installed within it.
