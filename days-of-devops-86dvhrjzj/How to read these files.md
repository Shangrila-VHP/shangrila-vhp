### Application for reading these files

- The files can be read in any text editor:
  - Notepad on Windows
  - vi/nano on *nix
  - Other GUI (graphical user interface) based text editors

- Personally, I feel that these files read better in Visual Studio Code. If you'd prefer, feel free to download VS Code via the official link by Microsoft: [Visual Studio Code Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
