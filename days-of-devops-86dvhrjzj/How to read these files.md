### Application for reading these files

- You can read these files directly from GitHub in any browser. The files should render automatically, in almost all browsers (Maybe even lynx by using the direct url. I haven't tested it). 
- The files under the 'Days of Devops' folder have been converted into the .md format (Markdown).
- If you have downloaded the files and/or cloned the repository and wish to read the files outside of the browser, then please see below.

### Text Editors

#### Notepad (Windows)
- Open the file in Notepad by double-clicking it or using the 'Open with' option.

#### vi/nano (*nix)
1. **Opening a file:**
   - `vi filename` or `nano filename`
   - **nano**: Press `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`.
2. **Exiting the editor:**
   - **vi**: Press `Esc`, type `:q`, and press `Enter`.
   - **nano**: Press `Ctrl + X`.
3. **Basic Navigation:**
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate the document.

### Summary
- **Vi** is more powerful but requires learning commands (like `:wq` to save and quit). It has two modes: command mode and insert mode.
- **Nano** is more beginner-friendly, with commands displayed at the bottom of the screen (e.g., `^O` to save, `^X` to exit).

#### Other GUI (graphical user interface) based text editors
- Files should render on most (if not all) GUI based text editors.
