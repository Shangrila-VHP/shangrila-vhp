### Application for reading these files

- You can read these files directly from GitHub in any browser. The files should render automatically. The files under the 'Days of Devops' folder have been converted into the .md format (Markdown).

### Text Editors

#### Notepad (Windows)
- Open the file in Notepad by double-clicking it or using the 'Open with' option.

#### vi/nano (*nix)
1. **Opening a file:**
   - `vi filename` or `nano filename`
   - **nano**: Press `Ctrl + O`, then `Enter`.
2. **Exiting the editor:**
   - **vi**: Press `Esc`, type `:q`, and press `Enter`.
   - **nano**: Press `Ctrl + X`.
3. **Basic Navigation:**
   - Use the arrow keys to navigate the document.

### Summary
- **Vi** is more powerful but requires learning commands (like `:wq` to save and quit). It has two modes: command mode and insert mode.
- **Nano** is more beginner-friendly, with commands displayed at the bottom of the screen (e.g., `^O` to save, `^X` to exit).

#### Other GUI (graphical user interface) based text editors
- Files should render on most (if not all) GUI based text editors.
