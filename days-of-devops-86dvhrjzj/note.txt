- Selective updates from the Days of Devops (id for internal ledger: 86dvhrjzj) can be shared publicly
- Scrutiny is required, line by line, not to accidentally share sensitive information and private comments e.t.c
- An action item has been created for the near future, in order to understand and then deploy the .gitignore feature
- All other action items will be directly logged under standard project management software for now. Not Github Project feature
