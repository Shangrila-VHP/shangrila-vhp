### Standard Logs

- <redacted to preserve privacy> I shared my learning here with the wider community. <redacted to preserve privacy> Note: It takes time and effort, to write a decent first draft for documentation purposes. And it is important to share. Within reason.
  - Sub-thought (Not related to the project): I am now intrigued with how stuff occurs at different levels for a system or a network. The implications for security and privacy. On the spectrum. But also, as the issues are resolved and layers are enabled. It could, in theory help make reality safer. I had some ideas when I was drafting the documentation and earlier on also.
- <redacted to preserve privacy> ish. <redacted> <redacted>. <redacted>.
- <redacted to preserve privacy> After the break, I am back. Tackle <redacted> issues. Then some action items below.
  - xx:03 Tackling <redacted> action item from below.
    - xx:15 There is a distinction between <redacted> and <redacted>/<redacted>. Just learned about this. Stopping the former.
    - xx:20 Issue tackled above. Now looking at slower receiving rates on the network. Reviewing these notes later on: The setup includes a mix of older and somewhat newer machines. ssds, SATA e.t.c I think, at this point it is fair to say that the router is invariably the cause of the slower transfer rates on the network side. So shifting to a separate network and/or using ethernet should help solve this issue.
    - xx:32 <redacted> protocol <redacted>.
      - xx:43 Still on it.
      - xx:55 Issue resolved successfully.
