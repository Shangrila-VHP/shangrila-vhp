- <redacted to preserve privacy> Just getting warmed up.
- <redacted to preserve privacy> Installing github client on the <redacted to preserve privacy>. With assistance from <redacted to preserve privacy>
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> Consulting with <redacted to preserve privacy> on the feasibility of installing <redacted to preserve privacy> made available by <redacted to preserve privacy> or to use <redacted to preserve privacy> (did not explore other options). Proceeding with the former and security consideration kept in mind. Briefly explored permissions also: <redacted to preserve privacy>
--- Proceeding with install <redacted to preserve privacy>
---- Installation Readme: <redacted to preserve privacy>
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> Installation proceeded without a glitch. In order to give back, I took a look at some of the questions others have asked and sought to assist one person.
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> After the installation, the app is showing up under Accessories. With assistance, I will move the icon under Programming. A location, where I feel this utility belongs. It will also have good company in that location ;)
--- <redacted to preserve privacy> Updating the 'desktop-database' did not resolve the issue. I logged out and logged back in and the issue persists.
--- Client is working. Added action item for icon.
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> Back after break/meal.
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> I shared my learning here with the wider community. <redacted to preserve privacy> Note: It takes time and effort, to write a decent first draft for documentation purposes. And it is important to share. Within reason.
--- Idea: I am now intrigued with how stuff occurs at different levels for a system or a network. The implications for security and privacy. On the spectrum. But also, as the issues are resolved and layers are enabled. It could, in theory help make reality safer. I had some ideas when I was drafting the documentation and earlier on also.
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> ish. <redacted> <redacted>. <redacted>.
-- <redacted to preserve privacy> After the break, I am back. Tackle <redacted> issues. Then some action items below.
--- xx:03 Tackling <redacted> action item from below.
---- xx:15 There is a distinction between <redacted> and <redacted>/<redacted>. Just learned about this. Stopping the former.
---- xx:20 Issue tackled above. Now looking at slower receiving rates on the network. Reviewing these notes later on: The setup includes a mix of older and somewhat newer machines. ssds, SATA e.t.c I think, at this point it is fair to say that the router is invariably the cause of the slower transfer rates on the network side. So shifting to a separate network and/or using ethernet should help solve this issue. 
---- xx:32 <redacted> protocol <redacted>.
----- xx:43 Still on it.
----- xx:55 Issue resolved successfully.
- xx:02 Figuring encryption stuff out.
-- xx:19 Will have to revisit encryption stuff another time.
-- xx:34 Note to self: Does the usage of two bullet points vs one, indicate that I have simply been warming up all this time? Hmm
- xx:34 to xx:23 Amongst other things, tinkering with VSCode plugins. However, need to shutdown.
