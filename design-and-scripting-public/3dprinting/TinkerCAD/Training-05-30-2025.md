Synthesis provided by Copilot and Claude. With regards to work effort under specific comments from issue #38. [link](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38#issuecomment-2924062663) and [link](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38#issuecomment-2923880643)

key points:

1. **Alignment Verification**:
   - Performed thorough checks of all 5 hinges
   - Discovered and fixed misalignments
   - Conducted visual inspections from multiple angles
   - Documented the process with numerous screenshots

2. **Technical Measurements**:
   - Verified 8mm diameter consistency across all 5 circular hinge portions
   - Found and addressed anomalies in hinge heights (8.66mm vs 8.82mm)
   - Corrected minor inconsistencies in anchor widths
   - Validated dimensions for both planks

3. **Quality Control Process**:
   - Ungrouped and regrouped components to verify measurements
   - Performed visual inspections of hinge cavities
   - Conducted manual separation tests for alignment
   - Standardized measurements across all anchor points

4. **Version Control**:
   - Updated working file to "05-30-2025 - Hinge & Rods only v 3.3_1_"
   - Documented all changes with timestamps
   - Completed recursive checks to ensure nothing was missed
   - Marked the portion as resolved (âœ”)

The comment shows a methodical approach to quality control and verification, with careful attention to detail and thorough documentation of the process. (Cheers :beer: Copilot!)
