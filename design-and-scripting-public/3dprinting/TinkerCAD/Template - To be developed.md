This is a practical demonstration that Copilot provided me, of what could go into the 'measurements and verification' section

Let me explain the "Measurements & Verification" section with a practical example from your hinge project:

#### Measurements & Verification
| Component | Current (mm) | Previous (mm) | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| Hinge Diameter | 8.00 | 8.66 | ‚úì | Standardized across all 5 hinges |
| Rod Diameter | 3.50 | 4.80 | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Reduced to prevent binding |
| Anchor Width | 8.00 | 8.82 | ‚úì | Fixed inconsistency |
| Plank Thickness | 3.20 | 3.20 | ‚úì | No change needed |
| Cavity Clearance | 0.20 | 0.15 | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Testing fit |


Key Features:
1. **Component**: Names the specific part being measured
2. **Current**: Shows new/updated measurement
3. **Previous**: Records last known measurement for comparison
4. **Status**:
   - ‚úì = Verified/Approved
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è = Needs attention/testing
   - ‚ùå = Failed verification
4. **Notes**: Brief context about the change

This format helps you:
- Track changes between versions
- Identify components that need attention
- Maintain a history of modifications
- Document the reasoning behind changes

Would you like to see how this would look with some of your other specific measurements from the hinge project?

Yes

#### Measurements & Verification
Last Updated: 2025-05-31 12:07:32 UTC
Verified by: @genidma

| Component | Current (mm) | Previous (mm) | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|-------|
| East Hinge Height | 8.00 | 8.66 | ‚úì | Standardized from variable height |
| West Hinge Height | 8.00 | 8.82 | ‚úì | Aligned with East hinge |
| Circular Portions | 8.00 | 8.00 | ‚úì | Verified all 5 hinges |
| Rod Inner Core | 3.50 | 4.00 | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Reduced for testing |
| Handle Opening | 4.50 | - | ‚úì | New component for chopstick |
| Plank Width | 12.00 | 24.00 | ‚úì | Reduced to fit workplane |

Verification Method:
- TinkerCAD measurement tool
- Manual visual inspection
- Cross-sectional view check

Related Changes:
- Eliminated disk cap from Hinge 05
- Standardized anchor measurements across all points
