- [x] Training: Core focus [Tinker with TinkerCAD](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38).
- - Pickup the door and hinges exercise from day before yesterday
- - ðŸŽ¯ Overall target is to complete 1 to 2 chapters from the book each day. Which could take 2 to 6 hours of [Deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
- - - Updates will go directly inside of the container (link is above)
- - - Change: No need for creating individual sub-folders for the markdown files and other exports. All files can go directly on the main TinkerCAD folder. Unless, there are too many files for the day and it starts getting unmanagable
- **Note to self**: This is where the markdown file is located: Under ....  -> design-and-scripting-public -> 3dprinting -> TinkerCAD -> In the folder for the day(s)
