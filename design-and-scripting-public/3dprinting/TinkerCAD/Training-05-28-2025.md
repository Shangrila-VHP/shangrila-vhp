- [x] Past midnight: Been keeping an eye on the 3d-print job. Tinkering around while the job runs through. And making sure that I don't disturb the 3d-print job, the printer bed, take out gunk while the print job is in progress e.t.c. Once one object moves even a little bit, the whole 3d-print job can go awry. | Update: Signing off 5 hours and 19 minutes later. I was also mucking aroung trying to get the pgp keys to work. The time was mostly spent baby-sitting the printer and pgp/gpg key fun. And a few other things (all related to the task at hand. But not really Deep and Structured Work)
- [x] Afternoon: Chatting with Chatgpt. Added a new issue [issue number 47](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/47) (Name: Prototype: Added: 05-25-2025: Pulleys and Gears (maybe motors) #47)
- [x] Created new release on Github. Still not sure how this feature works on Github.
- [x] Sharing working model of the door and hinge (this version only) on printables.com under a creative commons license. [Direct link to location on printables.com](https://www.printables.com/model/1311271-door-and-hinge)

- [x] During the evening, I was inside of Issue 38. Specifically, [here](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/38#issuecomment-2917914358). Copilot did a decent job of synthesizing the work effort. [link](https://github.com/copilot/c/070d2c83-7fb9-4a53-a83a-b1c33af047a5) Although, I am not sure if this link is going to be accessible publicly. 
- [x] Revised document to ensure that there are no open/pending items here. Pending items moved to the next day's wiki page.
- [x] Upload video from today's session. [link](https://youtu.be/10ji_eadlEc) & delete local files.

- The session focused on improving a TinkerCAD door and hinge design based on lessons learned from failed 3D prints.
- - Fixing the designs for a door part that broke when pressure was applied to it after it was 3d-printed. This was done, by increasing its width mostly.
- - Made a newer mechanism that prevents the door from opening outward.
- - Strengthened the front-facing wall by thickening it and adding four corner beams.
- - Faced challenges grouping new beamsâ€”decided to resize windows and regroup everything.
- - Noted the importance of grouping sub-units for easier assembly and scalability (like manufacturing).
