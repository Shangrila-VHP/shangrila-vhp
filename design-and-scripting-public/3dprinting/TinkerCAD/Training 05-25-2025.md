Added and/or Renamed:
- Prototype: Added: 05-25-2025: Pulleys and Gears (maybe motors) #47 [link](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/47) 
- Worker Safety and Prevention: Added on 05-22-2025: Particles in the air and in the environment #46 [link](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/46)

Updated:
- I updated a couple of tasks/issues, based on learnings from the weekend. 

Win:
- 3d-printed syringe completed

Learnings:
- Hinges don't 3d-print properly. As the mm scale dimensions are too small for them to latch on. Could be that coupled with the design itself.

Time dedicated (yesterday and today)
- I would say about 4 to 5 hours yesterday. In total. 
- 2.5 hours today
---

- Updates will go directly inside of the container (issues on Github)
- Change: No need for creating individual sub-folders for the markdown files and other exports. All files can go directly on the main TinkerCAD folder. Unless, there are too many files for the day and it starts getting unmanagable
- **Note to self**: This is where the markdown file is located: Under ....  -> design-and-scripting-public -> 3dprinting -> TinkerCAD -> In the folder for the day(s)
