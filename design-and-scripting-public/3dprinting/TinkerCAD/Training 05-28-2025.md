- [x] Been keeping an eye on the 3d-print job. Tinkering around while the job runs through. And making sure that I don't disturb the 3d-print job, the printer bed, take out gunk while the print job is in progress e.t.c. Once one object moves even a little bit, the whole 3d-print job can go awry. | Update: Signing off 5 hours and 19 minutes later. I was also mucking aroung trying to get the pgp keys to work. The time was mostly spent baby-sitting the printer and pgp/gpg key fun. And a few other things (all related to the task at hand. But not really Deep and Structured Work)
- [x] Chatting with Chatgpt earlier. Added a new issue [issue number 47](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/47) (Name: Prototype: Added: 05-25-2025: Pulleys and Gears (maybe motors) #47)
