[x] Been keeping an eye on the 3d-print job. Tinkering around. And making sure that I don't disturb the 3d-print job, bed, gunk e.t.c. Once one object moves even a little bit, the whole 3d-print job has to be started from the beginning. Update: Signing off 5 hours and 19 minutes later. But I was kind of mucking aroung trying to get the pgp keys to work. The time was mostly spent baby-sitting the printer and pgp/gpg key fun. And a few other things (all related to the task at hand. But not really Deep and Structured Work)
- See 'Main priority items for week of 05-26-2025..' at issue 36. [link](https://github.com/Shangrila-VHP/shangrila-vhp/issues/36)
- ðŸŽ¯ Overall target is to complete 1 to 2 chapters from the book each day. Which could take 2 to 6 hours of [Deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692)
-  Updates will go directly inside of the container (link is above)
- **Note to self**: This is where the markdown file is located: Under ....  -> design-and-scripting-public -> 3dprinting -> TinkerCAD -> In the folder for the day(s)
