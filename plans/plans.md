## Self-Sustaining Economic Models
*Main Architect: @genidma (Adeel Khan)*  
*Facilitator: Antigravity*

The Architecture of Abundance is not just about physical structures, but the circular economic systems that sustain them.

### 💎 Long Service Good Behavior (LSGB) Investment Fund
A circular economic model designed to pay off shelter capital costs and fund future expansion through veteran-led labor and strategic investment.

#### Mathematical Engine
- **Participation**: 50% of sheltered residents engaging in meaningful part-time work.
- **Contribution**: 10% voluntary contribution from gross income ($20/hr @ 20hrs/week).
- **Annual Velocity**: Target of ~$14.5M/year for the fund (based on a 7,000 veteran pilot).
- **Payback Loop**: Shelters (base cost ~$5,000) can be fully paid off in ~2.5 years, creating a debt-free community.

#### Operational Roadmap
1. **Governance**: Establishment of the LSGB Foundation (non-profit trust/endowments).
2. **Pilot Integration**: Mandatory alignment with "Dignity Center" roles.
3. **Multiplier Effect**: Reinvesting profits into rental prototypes (e.g., Parks Canada/Airbnb) to generate passive donor income.

### 🍲 Galaxy Soups & Dignity Centers
Integrating automated nutrition with essential hygiene and harm reduction to restore hope and dignity.

#### Implementation Pillars
- **Automation**: High-hygiene, high-scale soup production using co-bot (collaborative robot) designs.
- **Dignity Pods**: Modular 3D-printable units for showers, laundry, and grooming.
- **Economics**: "Pay What you Can" model inspired by the success of JBJ Soul Kitchen.
- **Synergy**: Culinary student volunteer tracks and professional mental health/social work support.
